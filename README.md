# Wine_Quality_prediction
Problem Statement :  To check whether the quality of the wine is good or not or how good the quality of the wine is. 
> Developed a system using machine learning that can predict the quality of the wine using some chemical parameters
> Got the data set which has this chemical parameters value
> Imported libraries and pandas and the ML model which we are using. In this project, we use Random Forest model.
> Analysed the data to check if there are any missing values
> Preprocessed and correlated the chemical parameters
> Trained and tested the model
